### SendGrid API

Some users may chose to use the SendGrid API to send customers an email after completing a purchase.

Ensure you have an account setup and then follow the steps below.

1. First head [here](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth) and then either use domain authentication (if you own a domain) which I would recommend, or you can just use Single Sender Verification. You may have to use the second if you don't own a domain.
2. Next head to [this link](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys) and then create an API key and give it full access, then copy that API key into your config.json
3. In your config.json you will find a section called fromEmail, in here you can set the address that the email will come from, if you previously authenticated the domain (in the first step) example.com you could use store@example.com as an example, but you can change store to whatever you wish
